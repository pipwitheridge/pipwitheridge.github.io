                I really loved reading this book. 
                What makes Walter Isaacson a great historian is that he's also a master storyteller.
                He's known for his biographies, particularly his best-selling <i>Steve Jobs</i>.
                In <i>The Innovators</i> he tells the story of how the digital age came about.

                The book goes further back than you might expect, looking at those who first dreamt of machines that could take human instructions and produce an output.
                It also goes deeper than you might expect, looking at the character flaws and tensions between innovators, and occasionally summarising key learnings about where innovation comes from: collaboration more than lone genius, bottom-up more than top-down, the bazaar more than the cathedral.
                As you might expect, the book does its job in going broad, looking at innovative technologies in turn: the computer, programming, the transistor, the microchip, video games, the internet, the personal computer, software, online, the web.

                Part of the appeal of the history of computing is its obsessive characters.
                Crunching code all night trying to make things work, foregoing personal hygeine, forgetting what time it is or what day it is—there's a nerdy romance to it all.
                Innovators often have a fascinating amount of focus.

                I just finished reading the final chapters and something that really struck me was how things we take for granted today—like social media or search engines—actually took a long time for people to think up.
                It makes me wonder what technology in the future will make people look back and think, 'why wasn't this around in 2023?'
                Somehow I don't think virtual-reality headsets are that technology, though people said the same about search engines and social media, so who knows?
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that stood out in the final chapters was this: the technologies that found success were those that played into the human need for connection.
                Before Wikipedia blew up, Nupedia was what people thought would. Not sure what Nupedia is? It was basically Wikipedia except only experts could write articles. It doesn't exist anymore. Why did Wikipedia succeed while Nupedia flopped? Because Wiki opened the door for mass collaboration and user-generated content, and didn't snub those without a PhD. It democratised expertise, both its consumption and its production.
            </p>

                I really liked this book and would recommend to anyone interested in learning about the history of the digital age.
