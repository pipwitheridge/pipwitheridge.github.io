                There's this quote I heard from an expert storyteller/videographer: "Interested is interesting". The idea is that what often captures peoples' interest is not something amazing or curious, but someone else's amazement or curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the earliest viral YouTube videos—the famous double-rainbow video—is a case in point. What made the video interesting wasn't the double-rainbow (we've all seen those). What made it interesting was how the guy took such a deep interest in it. He was truly, hilariously amazed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think there's a lesson to be learned here when it comes to evangelism. What makes a great evangelist is often not so much the interesting things they say, but the level of interest they show in what others have to say. Evangelism is sometimes defined as "telling people about Jesus", but good evangelism rarely ever starts there. It rarely starts with "let me tell you about Jesus." It almost always starts with "tell me about yourself."
            </p>
            <p>
                Another quote worth pondering: <i>"I went out to find a friend, and found none. I went out to be a friend, and found friends everywhere."</i> This is a profound truth: be the sort of person you wish to encounter. In evangelism terms we might adapt the quote: <i>"I went out to find someone spiritually curious, and found none. I went out to be spiritually curious, and found spiritually curious people everywhere."</i>
            </p>

                So, where to start? Begin cultivating an interest in spiritual things! Investigate faith, both yours and the faiths of others. Read your Bible and read books to help you understand it. Want more recommendations? Read John Dickson's <i>A Spectator's Guide to World Religions</i>. Read Graham Oppy's book <i>Atheism: The Basics</i>. If you're a listener, check out Alex O'Connor's <i>Within Reason</i> podcast, or Justin Brierley's <i>The Surprising Rebirth of Belief in God</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You could ask your colleagues what they've been reading and listening to, and if you get the same question back, that might open the door for a conversation about beliefs.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not always an easy principle to apply, but I think it's a powerful one. Interested is interesting. Don't focus on being interesting, focus on being interested. A question to reflect on: what spiritual things are you interested in right now? What theological questions are you pondering? What Bible passages are you wrestling with? What spiritual practices are you cultivating? Don't focus on getting others to explore faith unless you're willing to explore it yourself!
