            In this book, Paul Strathern unravels the history of chemistry, focusing on the quest for elements and the pivotal role of 19th-century Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleyev. After a restless period of solitude trying to uncover a system that made sense of the elements, Mendeleyev finally fell asleep at his desk. He had a dream which would shape the future of chemistry. When he awoke he wrote down what he had dreamed about—the periodic table.

            Strathern is a great story-teller of history. He makes clear that modern chemistry came from a long process of trial, much error, hard work, argument, experiment and discovery. These things make up the history of chemistry; they also make up the lives of some of its great dreamers.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a readable sketch of the history of chemistry for a popular audience.
