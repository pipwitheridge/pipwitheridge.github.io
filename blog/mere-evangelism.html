            My first real encounter reading C.S. Lewis came when I picked up <i>Suprised by Joy</i>. I was captured by his mastery of the English language and his ability to convey feelings you didn't know you already had deep down. Part of his appeal is that he claimed a freedom to write about so many different things, and so ended up touching on many aspects of the Christian life. For those of us who call ourselves Evangelical, it's a great joy to read someone so thoughtful on the topic of evangelism. I certainly found <i>Mere Evangelism</i> a joy to read, both for what it says and how it says it.

            In <i>Mere Evangelism</i>, Randy Newman—a Lewis expert and Senior Fellow for Apologetics and Evangelism at the C.S. Lewis Institute—compiles and comments on Lewis's insights on evangelism. He covers the necessity of pre-evangelism, the appeal to clues, the honouring of objections, the stirring of uneasiness, the centrality of the gospel, the value of imagery, the reality of opposition, the power of prayer, the timeliness of pushback, and the call to respond.

            I would recommend this book to anyone who both wants to remember the joys of reading C.S. Lewis and is interested in the topic of evangelism. For anyone involved in ongoing evangelistic conversations with non-believers, doubters or skeptics, this is a valuable read.
