            It’s easy to pray. We can pray anytime, anywhere, about anything. God is willing and ready to listen…
            </p>
            <p>
            …and yet… 
            </p>
            <p>
            …It’s hard to pray! Life is busy and full of distractions. We get lazy and tired. And even when we do carve out time to pray, questions come. Is God there? Do my prayers do anything? What should I pray for? 
            </p>
            <p>
            It’s somewhat comforting to know that Jesus’ own disciples struggled with prayer. They needed help to know how to pray (Luke 11:1). They fell asleep when Jesus asked them to pray (Luke 22:45). They tried doing things and failed because they didn’t pray (Mark 9:29).
            </p>
            <p>
            It’s also interesting that all sorts of people got prayer wrong in Jesus’ day. Some prayed loudly to impress people (Matt. 6:5) while others prayed long to impress God (Matt. 6:7). Jesus rebuked them both.
            </p>
            <p>
            Prayer is hard for all sorts of reasons, and yet it’s part of what we’re made for: to enjoy <i>relationship</i> with God. There are tonnes of tips out there on how to ‘improve’ in prayer, but I just want to share a few verses that help me in my struggle with prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Mark 1:35: Rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.
            </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Jesus made time and sought privacy to focus on prayer. If we want to be like Jesus, that includes praying like Jesus. His prayer life is the best place to start to form our own. See also Mark 6:46, Luke 9:29, Luke 11:1.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>
            Matthew 6:6: When you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
            </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Prayer is a relational activity between children and their father. To take time out of the day to pray in private takes real belief that God is there, that He wants a relationship, and that He is listening. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>
            Matthew 6:8: Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
            </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            God knows everything—even what we’re about to ask Him. Prayer is not about filling God in on things He doesn’t know. It’s about practicing dependence. This practice shouldn’t be pretentious. It can be brief and to the point (see the Lord’s prayer). 
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>
            Luke 21:36: Stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all the things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.
            </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Prayer is the right response to grasping the times we’re in. If we knew Jesus was returning next week, would we not spend much of this week in prayer? Prayer helps us prepare for Jesus’ return.
            </p>
            <p>
            God has made prayer possible... but it's not always easy. These verses have helped me wrestle with it.
