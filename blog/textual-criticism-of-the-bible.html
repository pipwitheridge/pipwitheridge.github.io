            Ever wondered what ancient texts are used as the basis for our modern translations of the Bible? Ever wondered how experts try to figure out the 'original' wording of the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament? Welcome to the weird, wonderful world of textual criticism.
            </p>
            <p>
            I've read a few books on textual criticism, but this one by Anderson and Widder is one I'd recommend. There's four basic reasons why.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Reason 1: it's understandable.</strong> While it'll be an easier read if you know Greek and/or Hebrew, language is definitely not a barrier to understanding this book.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Reason 2: it's comprehensive.</strong> Many books on textual criticism focus on either the Old Testament or the New Testament. That's because there's some big differences between textual criticism of the OT and the NT. But this book tackles both—showcasing their similarities as well as their differences.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Reason 3: it's short. Kind of.</strong> For a book on such a massive topic, it's actually relatively short. Not only does it cover both Old and New Testament textual criticism, but it does so in about 250 pages.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Reason 4: it's afforable.</strong> Academic books can often set you back $50+, but you can get the Kindle version of this for under $30 on Amazon. The paperback is a bit more.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Reason 5: it's recent.</strong> Textual criticism is a busy field with new insights emerging and new opinions being presented fairly often. So reading something recently published is a big plus. This book was published in 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
            For some, textual criticism might sound like the most boring thing in the world. For others, it's intriguing. Maybe it's time to explore? If so, this could be a helpful book along the way.
