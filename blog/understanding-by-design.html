            I read this book because I think that in order to take discipleship seriously, we need to take pedagogy seriously too. In other words, if we want to be good students of Jesus, we should care about how studying/learning actually works. And for those of us who want to "make disciples"—which includes "teaching" {'\u0028'}Matt 28:18-20{'\u0029'}—we should think hard about how the best teachers go about their craft. This book is not a Christian book, but because it is a classic text on best practice teaching and curriculum design, I think it's a helpful read for anyone involved in any form of teaching, as well as anyone seeking to become a better, more self-aware learner.

            The book presents a framework for crafting an effective curriculum based on end goals, and they call this "backward design". I think this is a really helpful concept for teaching within the church—whether designing a preaching program, a plan for the years' Bible Studies, an outline for a Children's Ministry curriculum, and so on. Teachers need to ask: "What do you want people to know, understand, and be able to do? How can we determine whether we've actually achieved this? What are the <i>best</i> learning experiences that will help people get there? How do we foster understanding rather than mere memorization, or mere fact-finding?"

            An example that stood out to me from the book was that of two primary-school classrooms, each trying to learn about apples. One classroom spent the whole term doing apple-related drawings, games, songs, and so on. The other classroom spent the whole term speeding through a textbook on apples from start to finish. Of course, nobody really learned that much about apples from either approach. The first fell into the ineffective 'activity-focused' mode of teaching, while the other fell into the error of 'coverage-focused' teaching. This was a great little story because it showed that well-intentioned teachers can fall into errors which mean their students don't learn much. There are many more teaching mistakes covered in the book, and these are super helpful to consider for anyone wanting to think about teaching—and learning.
            </p>

            I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in discipleship, particularly those with teaching responsibilities, and especially those responsible for any form of curriculum design.
