            When Paul preached the gospel in Thessalonica there were riots in the streets. They accused Paul of “turning the world upside down” (Acts 17:6). This is a good description of what the gospel does: it turns the world upside down. It turns our lives upside down. If the gospel is true, then God is real, Jesus died for sin, he rose again, he returned to heaven and he is returning to usher in his kingdom on earth as in Heaven. Being a Christian dramatically changes the way we see things.
            </p><p>
            But does it change the way we live? How does the gospel change our lives day-to-day while we wait for Jesus’ return?
            </p><p>
            This is Paul’s focus in 1 Thessalonians 4:1-12. He begins, “As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.” Jesus is returning, so live to please God. This raises an obvious question: how? 
            </p><p>
            Paul’s answer doesn’t cover everything. He addresses those things the Thessalonians were presumably struggling with. In verses 3-8 he talks about sex and self-control. Notice verse 7: “God did not call us to an impure life, but a holy life.” Living to please God means living a holy life in the way we use our bodies.
            </p>
            <h2>Work (vv. 9-12)</h2>
            <p>
            Paul talks about work in verses 9-12, which read: “Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.”
              </p><p>
            How should I live to please God? Paul says: work. Work while you wait. To understand why Paul says this we need some context.
            </p><p>
            <h3>Why The Thessalonians Needed To Hear This</h3>
             </p><p>
            Some of the Thessalonians had an idleness problem—a laziness problem. We get a hint of this in the next chapter. Paul says, “we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive…” (1 Thess. 5:14). 
         </p><p>
            Paul’s not accusing everyone of idleness. He’s not talking to those who can’t work because of injury or illness. He’s not talking to older widows who can’t work. He’s not talking to those whose work takes on some unpaid form, such as stay-at-home mums. He seems to be talking to those who can work, should work, but are unwilling to work.
        </p><p>
            This is clear from Paul’s second letter to the Thessalonians, where he says: “when we were with you, we gave you this rule: ‘The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.’ We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies. Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat.” (2 Thess. 3:10-12). 
        </p><p>
            Why were there lazy people in the church? Perhaps they thought that because Jesus is returning soon, there’s really no point in getting bogged down in a job. Yes, Paul wanted them to live as Jesus could return very soon. But he never told them to live as Jesus <i>would</i> return very soon. If you knew beyond doubt that Jesus was returning in six weeks, maybe you should quit your job. But nobody knows when Jesus is returning. It could be six weeks, but it could be six million years! We need to live as though Jesus could return at any moment, not as though he is returning at any particular moment.
        </p><p>
            Maybe they were lazy because they took for granted belonging to a church that shared everything they had. You could bank on others to provide your lunch and dinner. Instead of working, some spent their days chatting, gossiping, distracting, disrupting—taking what they had for granted.
        </p><p>
            Paul doesn’t like it, so he tells them to work. Paul’s not so concerned about how they work, but that they work. 
        </p><p>
            Paul essentially says: make it your ambition to settle down, be quiet, put your head down, work whatever job you need to. Work with your hands if you must; mind your own business and get on with it. Jesus is returning, so don’t be lazy. Work while you wait, because it’s pleasing to God. It’s pleasing to God because it’s loving to others. It’s loving to those inside the church they don’t have to bear the burden of your daily sustenance. It’s loving to those outside the church because your laziness is not an obstacle for to consider the gospel for themselves. 
        </p><p>
            The gospel is offensive enough to the watching world without obstacles being put in the way. In Acts 17 Paul comes across two kinds of philosophers—Epicurean and Stoic philosophers—and those philosophies give us a window into the beliefs of ancient Greece and Rome. A snippet from Epicurus reads: “Death means nothing to us … so long as we exist, death isn’t present, but whenever death is present we do not exist.” (Letter to Menoeceus, 125). A snippet from Marcus Aurelius, the most popular Stoic philosopher all time, reads: “In a short while you will be nobody and nowhere; and the same goes for all that you see now and everyone alive now.” (Meditations 12.21). 
        </p><p>
            This was a culture with little to no belief in life after death. Death was something to face, well, stoically. This was a culture that desperately needed to know that death is not the end of the story—that Jesus rose from death and offers eternal life.
        </p><p>
            When Paul preached the gospel it inevitably caused offense. But he gained respect by working hard. Their culture valued work and self-sufficiency. On the very first page of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations he says, “[it is a virtue] to work with my own hands and mind my own business, and to avoid gossip.” (1:5). 
        </p><p>
            Paul says the same thing to the Thessalonians, doesn’t he?
        </p><p>
            Love those inside and outside the church by working while you wait for Jesus’ return. The Thessalonians needed to hear this, but do we? I think so.
        </p><p>
           <h3> Why We Need To Hear This</h3>
        </p><p>
            When we think of who work is for, we often think it’s for ourselves. It’s for our fulfilment as human beings. After all, Adam and Eve worked the ground before the fall. It’s in our nature and for our good to work. The creation mandate is to cultivate the earth. It’s for our satisfaction, our fulfilment, our enjoyment, our sense of meaning—you’re not going to get that if there’s only six months left. Why bother?
        </p><p>
            There’s plenty of Christian books that present work in this way. The problem is that they often present work only in this way. There’s plenty of examples I could give, but let me pick on a very popular one: Timothy Keller’s Every Good Endeavour, subtitled Connecting Your Work to God's Plan For the World. In it he refers to the Genesis account 73 times. Do you know how many times he references Paul’s letters to the Thessalonians? Answer: zero times.
        </p><p>
            Why do I mention this? I just want to offer a corrective to the idea that my work is all about me. I think in our context, sometimes our issue is laziness—idleness—and we need to repent of that where it exists in our lives. But let me offer another thought: perhaps in our context, our issue with work isn’t so much idleness as it is idolatry. We hold our work up so high that it becomes the place where we seek satisfaction, fulfilment, and approval. It’s not enough to have a job—we need the right job with the right salary and the prestige that comes with it.
        </p><p>
            If Paul were here today he might remind us that the goal of life isn’t to love our work, it’s to love our God. The goal of work isn’t to love it, but to love others through it. When we get asked what work is for and we say, “look, I know it’s not about money and I know it’s not about what other people think of me”, Paul might say “just wait a second—it sort of is about those things.” We see that in 1 Thessalonians, don’t we?
        </p><p>
            I’m not saying work can’t be enjoyable and fulfilling. Ecclesiastes says we should rejoice and be glad when we find satisfaction in our work. But work often doesn’t feel satisfying. It can feel drab, slow, meaningless, tedious. There was a massive survey done in the UK about 10 years ago which found that among working adults, when asked whether their job made a meaningful difference to the world, 50% said ‘yes’, 10% said ‘not sure’ and 40% said ‘no’. When asked to what extent they find their job personally fulfilling, 43% said ‘not very’ or ‘not at all’. All this to say: as much as the world says work can fulfil you can make a big difference, the reality is it often doesn’t. 
        </p><p>
            So what’s the solution? Maybe it’s to try harder. To hustle. This is the antidote the world often gives. There’s more books and podcasts on productivity than ever before. And it’s easy to buy into. But as followers of Jesus we can’t serve two masters: we can’t worship both God and work. 
        </p><p>
            So what is the solution? The Bible has a high view of work—and so we shouldn’t demonize work. We shouldn’t draw the false conclusion that because Jesus could return at any moment, our job is meaningless. No—work is a great way to love others. It allows us to earn a living and not to be a burden on others. It allows us to support those amongst us who can’t work. When Christians work diligently for this purpose it’s a great witness to the watching world.
        </p><p>
            I observed a conversation recently between two Christians. One asked the other ‘how is your evangelism going at work?’ The other person said that they couldn’t actively start many gospel conversations, but they’ve had a few people come up and ask about church. I thought this was great, but the other person didn’t seem too thrilled, and they challenged them to go into work and to just ask someone flat out about their beliefs.
        </p><p>
            Here’s what I think: evangelism in the workplace is like fishing. Some people prefer spearfishing, and some prefer regular fishing. Spearfishing means you find your target and you go for it. It’s quick, it’s risky, it takes some skill, but it can be incredibly rewarding when it pays off. You go on the offense in conversation and try to persuade people. Then there’s normal fishing, where you set the bait, and you wait, alert and ready to have conversations as they present themselves. Being a dependable, honest, hardworking, humble Christian in the workplace is attractive to the watching world and can lead to gospel opportunities. We shouldn’t demonize work—it’s a great way to love outsiders.
        </p><p>
            On the flip side, we also shouldn’t idolize work. We shouldn’t view some forms of work are lower than others. Having a high-paying job does not mean you’re more valuable than someone with a low-paying job. Having an interesting job does not mean you’re more valuable than someone with a dull job. I think this is incredibly liberating—we don’t need to torture ourselves over landing our dream job; any job that helps us not to be unnecessarily dependent on others is a good job. Having this attitude is also a great witness to those around us. When people see that we don’t treat some people as less important or more important because of their job title, that’s compelling. When people see that we’re not crushed when we don’t get that promotion or raise, that’s interesting. When people see that we can do tedious work without gossiping or blaming or complaining that it is beneath us, that is compelling. 

        </p><p>
            <h2>Conclusion: Though he was rich...</h2>
        </p><p>
            In 2 Corinthians 8, we learn that the Thessalonians not only learned to be productive and generous amongst themselves, but their generosity overflowed to other churches. Paul says the goal is equality—and he never, ever commands someone who is rich to become poor so that someone who is poor might become rich. That would be unfair. And yet, that’s exactly what Jesus endured. Paul writes, “you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.” (2 Cor. 8:9). This is our king who became our servant, died for us, rose again, ascended and is reigning. How good it will be when he returns. As we wait, let’s live to please God.
