    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span></span>God creates the universe. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>He creates Adam and Eve and places them in the Garden of Eden. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Adam and Eve are deceived by a serpent, and they sin against God by eating forbidden fruit. God pronounces curses on them and puts them out of the garden.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Eve gives birth to Cain and Abel, and Cain kills Abel. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Adam’s son Seth bears descendants that lead down to Noah.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">6</span>God decides to blot out mankind, except for Noah, and He commands Noah to build an ark. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Noah builds the ark and enters it with his family and many animals, and a flood covers the Earth. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>The flood subsides and Noah exits the ark with his family and the animals. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>God establishes a covenant with Noah. Sadly, Noah shamefully gets drunk soon after. Noah’s grandson Canaan is cursed, and Noah dies. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Noah’s descendants are outlined.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>The people of the Earth build the Tower of Babel in an act of pride, so God confuses their languages and disperses them over the whole Earth.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>God tells Abram (a tenth-generation descendant of Noah) to leave his home to go to a land that God will show him. Abram complies and goes to Canaan with his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. God promises to give the land of Canaan to Abram’s offspring, and the group sojourns to Egypt. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>They leave Egypt and Abram separates from his nephew Lot. Abram settles in Canaan while Lot settles in Sodom.
    
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Foreign kings attack Lot’s hometown Sodom, but Abram and his men save them, so Melchizedek the High Priest blesses Abram. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>God establishes His covenant with Abram, assuring him that his many offspring will inherit the land of Canaan. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Abram’s barren wife Sarai tells Abram to have a child with their servant Hagar, so Abram does, and Hagar gives birth to Ishmael.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>God changes Abram’s name to Abraham, and establishes the covenant of circumcision with him. God changes Sarai’s name to Sarah, and promises her a child of her own, who will be called Isaac. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>God appears to Abraham and assures him that Sarah will have a son. He also says He will survey Sodom and Gomorrah and will destroy them if there are no righteous people there.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>God brings Lot out of Sodom with his wife and daughters, and then destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot’s wife looks back and turns into a pillar of Salt. Lot’s two daughters sleep with Lot, and become pregnant.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Abraham sojourns in Gerar and tells people that Sarah is his sister, to protect her. The king of Gerar takes Sarah, but is told by God that Sarah is in fact Abraham’s wife, so he returns her to Abraham and reconciles with Abraham. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Sarah gives birth to Isaac. God promises Hagar that her son Ishmael will become a great nation. Abraham establishes a covenant of peace with the king of Gerar, and then sojourns in the land of the Philistines.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. As Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac, God provides an animal sacrifice for Abraham, who proved his faithfulness to God. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Sarah dies and is buried by Abraham. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Abraham tells a servant to go and get a wife for Isaac, so the servant goes outside Canaan and gets Rebekah, who comes back to Isaac and becomes his wife. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Abraham dies and is buried. Isaac’s wife Rebekah gives birth to Jacob and Esau, and Esau sells his birthright to Jacob. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Isaac sojourns in Gerar and establishes a covenant of peace with Abimelech king of Gerar. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Jacob pretends to be Esau so that his father Isaac would bless him. The plan works, and Esau is furious with Jacob.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Isaac sends Jacob to Laban (Rebekah’s brother) to find a wife. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Jacob works for Laban, but is tricked into sleeping with Leah (Laban’s older daughter), but he continues to work and eventually marries his true love Rachel (Laban’s younger daughter). <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Leah and one of her servants, and Rachel and one of her servants, bear Jacob the following sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulon, and Joseph (these make up eleven of the twelve tribes of Israel). <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Jacob realises that Laban no longer sees him with favour, so he flees with his wives towards Canaan. Laban pursues him, catches up to him, and they establish a covenant of peace with one another. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Jacob wrestles with God on his way to Canaan, and his name is changed to Israel.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Israel and Esau joyfully reunite, and Israel arrives at Canaan safely. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>The Hivites (neighbours of the Israelites in Canaan) are tricked and defeated in battle by the sons of Jacob, following the rape of Dinah (a daughter of Israel) by Shechem (a Hivite). <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Rachel dies while giving birth to Benjamin, who is to become the twelfth tribe of Israel. Isaac also dies. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Esau’s descendants are outlined.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Joseph is hated by his brothers, and is sold to traders. They take him to Egypt to be a servant of Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Judah impregnates his own daughter-in-law, who he thought was a roadside prostitute. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Potiphar’s wife tries to seduce Joseph, but he resists the temptation. Potiphar’s wife then accuses Joseph of abuse, so he is put into prison. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Joseph interprets a few dreams of Pharaoh’s servants, but when they retire they forget about him. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Joseph interprets one of Pharaoh’s dreams, revealing that there will be seven years of prosperity followed by seven years of famine in Egypt. Pharaoh appoints Joseph to be second in command over Egypt. Manasseh and Ephraim are born to Joseph.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>The famine begins, and people start to come to Egypt to buy supplies. Ten of Joseph’s brothers come and try to buy supplies, but Joseph recognises them and tells them that unless they also bring the eleventh brother (Benjamin) with them, he won’t let them buy. They go back home and tell this to Israel, who is extremely anxious about the whole thing. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Joseph’s brothers bring Benjamin to Egypt. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Joseph tests his brothers’ integrity by putting a valuable item in their bags that doesn’t belong to them, and they come back to Egypt and tell the truth to Joseph. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Joseph reveals himself as Joseph to his brothers, and they all rejoice. Joseph’s brothers go up to Canaan to bring their father Israel down to Egypt to live there with Joseph.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Joseph’s father and brothers come to Egypt, and <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Joseph gives his family land to settle in. <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>Israel blesses Ephraim and Manasseh (Joseph’s sons), and <span class="verseNumber">4</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>blesses his sons who will make up the twelve tribes of Israel. Israel dies and is buried. <span class="verseNumber">5</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>After burying Jacob, Joseph reassures his brothers that they are forgiven for what they have done in that past to Joseph, and that God has used all that has happened for good.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>A new Pharaoh rises up in Egypt and oppresses the Israelites. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>Moses is born and is hidden from Pharaoh.

    <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Moses and Aaron tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go, but Pharaoh refuses. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>God reassures Moses that He will bring the Israelites out of Egypt. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>God sends plagues upon Egypt.

The king of Moab, Balak, fears that Israel will destroy Moab, so He calls upon Balaam – a man renowned for the ability to pronounce blessings and curses – to curse Israel.

The workers find the book of the law (which was lost) in the temple. They bring it to Josiah, who reads it and weeps. God tells Josiah that he will destroy Judah because of its sinfulness. Josiah brings all of Judah together, reads the book of the law in their presence, and they enter into a covenant of obedience to God. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Judah celebrates the Passover.

During the reign of Artaxerxes, the enemies of Judah write a letter to Artaxerxes requesting that the exiles be made to stop building, and the request is granted. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>The exiles resume rebuilding the temple without permission, and the enemies write a letter to Darius, the current king, asking him to search and see whether a decree was ever really made by Cyrus allowing the exiles to rebuild. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>King Darius finds the decree set by Cyrus, allowing the exiles to rebuild, so he decrees for the enemies to keep away from the rebuilding, and to stop annoying the exiles. The exiles finish rebuilding the temple, and they celebrate the Passover.

    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>The preacher explains that all is vanity. You can’t be satisfied in the world and what it offers. There’s nothing new under the sun. Seeking wisdom and seeking folly are both strivings after wind.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>The preacher spent time seeking pleasure and indulgence, but this was vanity. He spent time seeking after wisdom, and he realised that there is more gain in wisdom than folly, even though both paths lead to the same end. He sees that toil and labour is also vanity. He sees that the best one can hope for is to find enjoyment in his toil and in God’s gifts of food and drink. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>The preacher acknowledges that there is a time for everything; for mourning and laughing, for speaking and silence, and so on. The preacher again realises that there is nothing better for man to do than to rejoice in his work. He sees that both man and beast live and die the same, for all is vanity. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>The preacher considers all the oppression that happens in the world. He continues to see that labour is done in vain, but he notes that two or three people working together is better than one. He notes again that wisdom is greater than folly.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span>The preacher says to be cautious in prayer; to let your words be few, and to fear God. He says that a lover of money will not be satisfied. He maintains that it is good to find enjoyment in one’s toil: this power to enjoy is a gift from God. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>The preacher says that it is an evil when man cannot find joy or satisfaction in his toil; when God does not give him the power to do so. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>The preacher contrasts wisdom and folly. The house of mourning is better than the house of feasting; a wise man’s rebuke is better than a fool’s song; patience is better than pride. The preacher sees God’s sovereignty as a comfort. He notes something which is worse than death: a treacherous woman. He considers the depravity of man. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>The preacher says it’s good to keep the king’s command, and to fear God. He acknowledges that the wicked don’t always seem to get what they deserve on Earth. He reaffirms the goodness of finding joy in one’s work. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>The preacher contemplates this evil; that everyone – the wise and the foolish – eventually dies. He says that those headed for Sheol should eat bread, drink wine, and be glad while they can. He continues to contemplate wisdom as more valuable than folly or military strength. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>The preacher continues to prize wisdom above folly. He sees another evil in the world; that people in positions of high authority often aren’t suited or qualified for the job, and that those in low places would often to a better job.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>The preacher calls for people to acknowledge their lack of knowledge; to acknowledge that anything can happen at any time on Earth. He tells youth to enjoy themselves but to remember that judgement is coming. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>The preacher tells youth to remember their creator before they get old and find no pleasure in life; before they grow old and die. The preacher ends by exhorting people to fear God and keep his commandments, because God is going to judge everyone in the end.

She goes out to search for him, but she is beaten up by city watchmen. She goes to her friends for help to find the king, and the friends ask why she desires the king so much. The woman explains her admiration; she admires his head, hair, eyes, cheeks, lips, arms, legs; the king is her beloved and her friend. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>The two find each other again and the king describes her beauty to her; her eyes, hair, teeth and cheeks. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>The king continues to describe her beauty, and she tells him to come with her into the fields to share their love.

But if they don’t, God will cast them out of His sight. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>God will bring doom upon Israel because of their perpetual backsliding. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>Jeremiah weeps because of Israel’s wickedness and impending destruction.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>The word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel the priest while he is in Babylon. He sees a stormy wind from which come four living creatures, all with strange appearances. They follow the spirit in whatever it does. Ezekiel hears a voice and sees a majestic throne, upon which sits a likeness of a human appearance. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>The one on the throne speaks to Ezekiel. He is sending Ezekiel to the people of Israel, who have rebelled against him. He tells Ezekiel not to be afraid, and gives him a scroll with words of lamentation written on it. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>God tells Ezekiel to eat the scroll and to go and speak to the exiles, and Ezekiel does so. God says that Ezekiel will be a watchman over the house of Israel who will give them warnings. Ezekiel will be mute, and will only be able to speak when God gives him a message to speak.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>God tells Ezekiel to build a small siege works around a single brick, to act as a sign for the house of Israel. Ezekiel lies down next to the siege to illustrate the time that Israel and Judah will spend in punishment. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>God tells Ezekiel to cut off his hair, and destroy the hair by fire, sword and scattering to the wind. God will execute judgements such as these against Jerusalem in the sight of the nations.  <span class="verseNumber">6</span>God will destroy the high places, idols, and idolaters within Israel. But God will let some people live, and they will remember Him among the nations. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>God will bring destruction upon Israel because of its wickedness. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Ezekiel again sees a form that has the appearance of a man, and the man shows him a vision of all the abominable idols of Israel. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>God sends executioners to kill all the idolaters in Jerusalem, but He tells them not to harm anyone who has a special mark on them, signifying their abstinence from idolatry.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>God tells a man to get hot coals from the cherubim in the Temple, and to scatter them over Jerusalem. Ezekiel sees the glory of the Lord leaving the threshold of the Temple, along with the four living creatures with strange appearances. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>God will bring punishment upon those who devise iniquity and give wicked council in Jerusalem. God tells Ezekiel that He will save a remnant of Israel; He will bring them out of exile and place them again in Canaan. He will give them a new heart and a new spirit to follow Him.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Ezekiel goes to the first exiles in Babylon and makes for himself baggage like that of an exile. He brings out the baggage by day, as a sign to the exiles that others from Israel will be taken into captivity. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>God tells him to prophesy against the false prophets of Israel, who pretend to speak God’s words and predict peace when there is no peace. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>God calls Israel to repent of idolatry. He will punish those who refuse to repent and He will bring disaster upon Jerusalem, but a righteous remnant will remain. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>God will bring destruction upon Jerusalem, just as fire consumes a useless vine. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Israel is like an unfaithful bride – it trusted in the nations instead of trusting in God. Therefore God will bring disaster upon Israel, but one day He will atone for their sin and enter into a new covenant with them. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Ezekiel speaks a riddle to the house of Israel, involving two eagles (Babylon and Egypt) and a vine (Israel). The riddle illustrates that while being exiled, rather than humbling themselves before the Babylonians and keeping a covenant of peace with them, Israel tried to call to Egypt for help. Israel will suffer because of this action. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>People will be held accountable for their sins, not the sins of their fathers or sons. The righteous shall live; the wicked shall die. God does not take pleasure in the death of anyone, so He calls all to repent and live.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Ezekiel laments for the princes of Israel. He speaks two metaphors: one about a lioness mother with two cubs who are taken to Babylon, and another about a vine with a weak stem, to illustrate the plight of the princes of Israel.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Ezekiel speaks to the elders of Israel and recounts how God brought Israel out of Egypt and preserves them despite their wickedness. He has acted for the sake of His name, that it should not be profaned by the nations. But now God will scatter Israel in foreign countries, but a remnant will be saved and returned to Israel, where they will worship God sincerely.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>God will draw His sword against all flesh. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Israel has shed much blood and set up many idols, so God will strike them and and scatter them among the nations. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Samaria whored after Assyria, and God gave Samaria into their hands for destruction. Jerusalem whores after Babylon, and God will likewise give Jerusalem into their hands for destruction.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>The king of Babylon lays siege to Jerusalem, and Ezekiel compares Jerusalem to a boiling pot. Ezekiel’s wife dies, but God tells him not to mourn or weep, because when God destroys Jerusalem its people will not mourn but shall simply groan to one another as they rot away in their sin.  <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>God will execute vengeance on Ammon, Moab, Seir, Edom and Philistia, because of their wicked ways. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>God will bring Tyre to a dreadful end because they acted wickedly against Israel. God will send the king of Babylon to destroy them. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Ezekiel laments for Tyre, because it is a wealthy city with many trading partners. But God will bring Tyre to a dreadful end. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>The Prince of Tyre has grown proud in his wealth, so God will bring him to an end. Ezekiel laments for the Prince of Tyre. God will also destroy Sidon. God will gather Israel from the nations, and they shall dwell securely in their own land. <span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>God will make Egypt desolate because of their pride and deceptiveness. He will give Egypt into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Ezekiel laments for Egypt, because God will use Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to put an end to the wealth of Egypt. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Pharaoh and his multitude shall be brought down and destroyed because of their pride. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Ezekiel laments for Egypt, because God will use Babylon to destroy them, and they shall descend to the grave along with the other destroyed nations. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>God has set Ezekiel as a watchman over the house of Israel, to tell the people to repent. God has done this because he doesn’t take pleasure in the death of the wicked, but He wants them to turn back and live. Jerusalem will become desolate because of its complacency and pride.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Ezekiel prophesies against the self-seeking shepherds of Israel who refuse to nurture the sheep. God will rescue His sheep from among the nations and will provide for them. He will make a covenant of peace with them and will be their God, and He will set David as prince over them. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>God will make Mount Seir desolate because it hated Israel, and <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>He will punish the nations surrounding Israel.

    <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">7</span>Ezekiel enters a valley full of bones. God breathes life into the bones and they stand and live. God will put His Spirit within His people and He will put them in their own land. God tells Ezekiel to pick up two sticks and join them together, illustrating that God will join Israel and Judah together. His people will be one nation, David will be their king and prince, and God will save them from their sin. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">8</span>When Israel are gathered back to their land and dwell securely, the land of Gog will come and attack Israel. On that day God’s anger will be aroused; there shall be a great earthquake in the land and mountains will tumble down. Gog will be destroyed by sword, and God’s greatness shall be known by many nations. <span class="verseNumber">3</span><span class="verseNumber">9</span>Gog will be defeated, and Israel will bury the people of Gog. They will celebrate with a feast prepared by God; they shall eat flesh and drink blood. God will set His glory among the nations, and they shall see His judgement.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon besieges Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah. He brings exiles to Babylon, and supplies a group of them with food and education within his palace. Among these are Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. They stay faithful to God; they abstain from the king’s food and grow in wisdom. They are chosen to stand before Nebuchadnezzar as hired servants.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>Nebuchadnezzar has a dream, and he seeks out magicians to tell him the dream and interpret it. No magician can do it, but God reveals the dream to Daniel, who goes to Nebuchadnezzar and interprets the dream. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego are all promoted. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Nebuchadnezzar makes a golden idol, and he commands all people to worship it. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refuse, so they are thrown into a fiery furnace. They survive the fire and are joined by a fourth figure. Nebuchadnezzar brings the three out of the furnace, and promises to punish anyone who blasphemes against the God of Israel.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Nebuchadnezzar has a dream involving an impressive tree being chopped down. Daniel interprets the dream, saying that Nebuchadnezzar will be driven away, and he will dwell in the fields like an animal until he understands that God is king. It happens, and Nebuchadnezzar praises God and is re-established in Babylon.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Nebuchadnezzar’s son Belshazzar becomes king in Babylon. He prepares a feast for his staff, and they drink wine and praise false gods. A human hand appears and writes a message on the palace wall. Daniel interprets the message for Belshazzar, saying that Babylon will be divided and given to the Medes and Persians. That night, Belshazzar is killed and Darius, a Mede, takes the kingdom. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Belshazzar plans to promote Daniel, so the other staff plot against him. They convince Belshazzar to order all people to worship him alone. Daniel refuses and continues to worship the true God, and he is thrown into a den of lions. He survives, and Belshazzar has the other staff thrown in. Belshazzar makes a decree that everyone is to fear Daniel’s God.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Daniel sees a vision of four great beasts who are four kings. He sees the Ancient of Days sitting on a throne with myriad people surrounding Him. He sees the greatest beast/king killed, and the other three live for a while after. He sees one like a son of man approach the Ancient of Days, and He is given dominion and glory and an everlasting kingdom. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Daniel sees a vision of a Ram with two horns (Media and Persia). The ram is defeated by a goat with a great horn (Greece). The great horn falls, and in its place four other horns/kingdoms arise. One of the horns grows exceedingly large. Likewise, an evil king shall arise who shall destroy many and rise up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken.

    <span class="verseNumber">9</span>Daniel prays to God and confesses the sin of Israel, and pleads for mercy upon Jerusalem. A man called Gabriel reveals to Daniel that there shall be seventy weeks in which to finish transgression, put an end to sin, atone for iniquity, bring in everlasting righteousness, and anoint a most holy place. An anointed prince shall come and establish a strong covenant with his people. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Daniel receives a vision of a majestic man in linen, who tells him that he has come to make him understand what is to happen to God’s people in the latter days.

When he does so, Greece will come. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>The man in linen prophesies the oncoming political tensions and military attacks between areas and nations of the Near East, such as Persia, Greece, Egypt, the northern kingdoms and the southern kingdoms. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>The man in linen says that there will come a time when Michael – the prince of God’s people – shall arise.

They bear two sons – Jezreel and Not My People – and a daughter named No Mercy. God will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel. God won’t have mercy on Israel, for they are no longer His people. However, Judah and Israel will one day unite as God’s people with one head.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>God tells Hosea to repudiate his marriage to Gomer because of her sinfulness, for God will repudiate Israel because of its sinfulness.

    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Paul wants to go to Rome to preach the gospel, because those who put their faith in Jesus will be counted righteous and will be saved, but the unrighteous shall be subject to God’s wrath. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>God’s judgement rightly falls on those who practice evil, while those who obey God will be justified. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>No one obeys God perfectly; all are under sin. Therefore, no one can be saved by works of the law. However, God sent Jesus as a propitiation for our sin, so that we can be justified by God’s grace as a gift, by putting our faith in Jesus. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>Faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness, and those who put their faith in Jesus will be counted as righteous. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Christ died for the ungodly, so now we have peace with God. Adam’s sin brought condemnation, but Jesus’ sacrifice leads to justification and life.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">6</span>God’s people shouldn’t continue in sin. Because of Jesus’ death and resurrection, Christians should consider themselves dead to sin and alive to God; free from sin and slaves to righteousness. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>The law is good in that it conveys God’s commands, but it is not enough for salvation because sinful people can’t obey the law. Christians no longer serve in the old way of the written law, but they serve in the new way of the Spirit. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Christians have the Holy Spirit living in them. Jesus died so that the righteous requirement might be fulfilled for Christians, who are now sons of God and heirs of God with Christ, provided we suffer with Him, and by the Spirit put sin to death. The Spirit helps us in our weakness, and nothing can separate us from the love of Christ.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">9</span>God predestines those He saves. This predestination is not based on man’s works, but on God’s will. He rightfully does this: He is the creator; He can do what He wants. In not saving some, He makes known the riches of His glory to those He saves. Righteousness comes through faith, both for Jew and Gentile; <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>everyone who puts their faith in Jesus will be saved. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>While not all Israelites (by descent) have put their faith in Jesus, this doesn’t mean God hasn’t kept His promises to Abraham; God has not rejected those whom He foreknew. Through Israel’s trespass, salvation has been offered to the Gentiles. God has consigned disobedience to all, so that He may show mercy to all without distinction. God is severe towards those who don’t have faith in Him, but kind to those who do.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Christians are to present themselves as living sacrifices by being transformed by the renewal of their minds, so that they may discern and do what is good, becoming more like Jesus in every way. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Christians are to be subject to the governing authorities. Christians are to pay to all what is owed to them, love their neighbour as themselves, and put sin to death. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">4</span>Christians are to be humble; not judging others or being a hindrance to others, but aiming for mutual encouragement, doing everything by faith in Jesus. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">5</span>Christians are to imitate Christ in bearing with one another for the glory of God. Christ brings hope to both Jew and Gentile. Paul is a minister to the Gentiles, and hopes to come to Rome soon. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">6</span>Paul wants the Romans to be wise as to what is good, and innocent as to what is evil, to the glory of God.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Paul is thankful that God has shown the Corinthians grace in Jesus Christ. Paul wants there to be no division among the Corinthians. Paul wants them to be united in keeping Christ crucified the centre of all they do and teach.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>Paul keeps Christ crucified the centre of all he does and teaches. Jesus is the wisdom of God, revealed to us through the Holy Spirit, whom we have received to teach us about Jesus. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Paul is concerned that the Corinthians are still of the flesh, for there is still jealousy and division among them. Paul reminds the Corinthians that he has laid the foundation by preaching Christ crucified, and those who build upon that foundation must do so in such a way that keeps Christ the centre. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>God’s people are servants of Christ and stewards of the gospel. God has given Christians everything in Christ, making them rich. But at the same time Christians are the scum of the world, because to the world Christ is folly. Paul admonishes the Corinthians to know this, to trust in God, and to be faithful in Christ.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Paul addresses the fact that there is sexual immorality among the Corinthians. Paul calls for the Corinthians to repent of their arrogant boasting, their malice and their evil, and to celebrate in sincerity and truth the fact that Christ has been sacrificed for them. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Paul warns the Corinthians that the unrighteous will not inherit God’s kingdom. He tells them to flee sexual immorality, and tells them to glorify God in their bodies. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Paul gives the Corinthians some principles for marriage; principles that aim to minimise anxiety and secure undivided devotion to God. Paul tells the Corinthians to live as they were called, while keeping the commandments of God. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>What we eat doesn’t make us right with God. Christians ought to love God, and not cause others to stumble. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>They are to endure anything, give up everything, become a servant to all – doing everything it takes to preach the gospel.

    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span>By God’s grace, we are made competent to be ministers of a new, more glorious covenant. By the Spirit we have an unbreakable hope, therefore we are bold. By the Spirit we are being made more like Jesus. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>In weakness and affliction we preach the gospel, and it is God who powerfully saves people. While we suffer now, there is an eternal weight of glory that is ours in Christ. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Our gospel convictions drive our actions. We live in the world now, but God an eternal home prepared for us. Therefore we are courageous and faithful.

    <span class="verseNumber">6</span>Paul calls the Corinthians to widen their hearts. He tells them be holy as a church; to not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Paul recounts his trip to Macedonia, the coming of Titus, and his first letter that he wrote to the Corinthians, which made them grieve with a godly grief which has produced a repentance that leads to salvation. Paul has perfect confidence in the Corinthians. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>He tells of the generosity of the churches of Macedonia, and encourages the Corinthians to also be generous. He tells them that Titus is coming to visit them. <span class="verseNumber">9</span>He encourages the Corinthians to make ready a financial gift for the suffering Christians in Jerusalem. He reminds them that God loves a cheerful giver, and that they will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, to the glory of God.

He tells of his extensive persecutions as a Christian, and his impressive qualifications as a Jew. However, he says that he will boast in what highlights his weakness, namely, the death and resurrection of Jesus. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Paul says that God’s strength is magnified in human weakness, and that is why he is content in weakness for the sake of Christ.

He assures them that the gospel is not a human fabrication, but a divine message of salvation. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>He recounts how he himself was faced with false teachers, but he did not submit to them but maintained that salvation is by grace alone; by faith in Jesus and not by works of the law. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>He rebukes the Galatians, saying that those who rely on works of the law won’t be saved, but those who put their faith in Jesus will be saved. Just as Abraham’s faith was counted as righteousness, so our faith is counted as righteousness.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>In Christ we are no longer slaves to sin but sons of God and heirs through God. Paul is perplexed that the Galatians would even consider returning to the worthless false teachings of works-based righteousness. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>He warns the Galatians that Christ is no advantage to those who put their faith in circumcision and other works of the law for righteousness. He tells the Corinthians to put their faith in Jesus, and to walk by the Spirit. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>He exhorts the Galatians to bear one another’s burdens, and to persevere in doing good. He tells the Galatians not to boast in their flesh, but to boast and trust in Jesus, in whom we have salvation.

Paul prays that God would grow the Ephesians in the knowledge of Him; in the knowledge of who God is and what He has done.
    
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>We were dead in our sins, but our merciful God has made us alive with Christ. This salvation is by grace through faith – not of works. All who are under this grace have been made one in Christ; nobody is separated. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Paul wants all to know the mystery of the gospel: that in Christ, everyone – Jews and Gentiles – are partakers in salvation through faith. Paul prays that the Ephesians might know the love of Christ, and have Christ dwell in their hearts through faith.

    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>In light of Christ’s love, Paul urges the Ephesians to repent of sin and to be renewed in the spirit of their minds; to put off the old self and to put on the new self. God gracefully equips the saints for the work of ministry and the building up of the church. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Paul urges the Ephesians to walk in love, imitating Christ. He calls them to put off sin and to be holy. He calls wives to submit to their husbands, and he calls for husbands to love their wives. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>He calls for children to obey their parents, and slaves to obey their masters.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>The author speaks of God revealing Himself through Jesus. Jesus is God and has made purification for sins, and He is superior to angels.<span class="verseNumber">2</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Jesus is perfect, and He died to save those who are slaves to the fear of death. He suffered when tempted so that He can help those who are being tempted. He is the founder of salvation, so we can’t neglect Him, but rather we must pay much closer attention to Him. <span class="verseNumber">3</span>Consider Jesus, who is worthy of more glory than Moses, and hold fast your confidence in Him. Don’t harden your heart, but exhort each other daily, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">4</span>The promise of entering God’s rest still stands. We must strive to enter that rest by holding fast our confession about Jesus, who is able to sympathise with us in our weaknesses, and whom we can approach at any time for mercy and help. <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Jesus is a greater High Priest, for He was appointed by God and He was made perfect through suffering. We must move on from being infants; unskilled in God’s word, and we must become mature; able to discern between good and evil. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>We must be mature in our faith and teaching, and we must hold onto God’s certain promise by faith and patience.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">7</span>Melchizedek was both a king and a priest during the time of Abraham. No beginning or end is recorded of him. However, Jesus is greater than Melchizedek. Jesus holds His priesthood eternally by an irrevocable oath of God. Jesus introduces us to a better hope and a better covenant through which we draw near to God. He is holy, innocent, unstained, and He offered himself as a one-time sacrifice for all. <span class="verseNumber">8</span>Jesus is High Priest of a better covenant; one which is enacted on better promises, where God writes His word on His people’s hearts, His people all know Him, and He forgives them of all sin.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">9</span>The old covenant, involving animal’s blood being continually sacrificed in the Earthly holy place by sinful intercessory High Priests, was not sufficient for salvation. Jesus is the mediator of a new covenant, involving Jesus’ blood being shed once to bring about salvation for all who put their faith in Him, and Jesus acting as a faithful intercessory High Priest for us in heaven. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">0</span>Jesus died once for all. Let us therefore draw near to God with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us put off sin and hold onto the confidence we have in Jesus.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">1</span>Faith is the conviction of things not seen. By faith the people of old received their commendation. Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Rahab, and many others, were accepted by God on the basis of faith. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">2</span>Since we are surrounded by so many faithful witnesses from the past, let us put sin to death and run the race of faith, looking to Jesus, who founded and perfects our faith, and who endured suffering for our sake. Let us endure like Jesus did, and let us be grateful that Jesus gives us a kingdom that cannot be shaken. <span class="verseNumber">1</span><span class="verseNumber">3</span>Keep looking to Jesus and keep seeking the Kingdom that is to come. Become more like Jesus in your actions and acknowledge Jesus in everything. The author asks the Hebrews to pray for him and his brothers.

    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">2</span>As we come to Jesus, the living stone, we ourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house; a holy priesthood, that we may proclaim the gospel of Christ.

    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Through faith, Christians partake of the divine nature and escape the corruption that is in the world due to sin. We are to supplement our faith with virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection and love. In practicing these qualities and bearing good fruit, we make our election sure. We know the power and majesty of Jesus through the prophetic word which comes from God.

    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">1</span>Jesus is the word of life and He brings about eternal life. God is light, and Christians must walk in the light so that they might have joyous fellowship with one another, and so that Jesus would cleanse them from all sin. <span class="verseNumber">2</span>Jesus is our advocate – we can find forgiveness in Him when we sin. We may know that we are in Christ by keeping His commandments. We must not love the world or the things of the world, but we must let what we’ve learned about Jesus abide in us, and cling to Jesus as our Lord and saviour.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">3</span>We must continually remember that God has loved us and called us His children, and we must hope in Him. Everyone who makes a practice of sinning is not in Jesus. We must love one another, looking to Jesus, for by His sacrifice on the cross we truly know what love is. <span class="verseNumber">4</span>We must be careful when listening to teachers/spirits, for if they do not confess that Jesus is Lord then they are false. In light of God’s love for us and His sending Jesus to die for us, we should love others.
    <hr></hr>
    <span class="verseNumber">5</span>Jesus is the true God and eternal life. In light of this, we must love God and obey His commandments, knowing that we have eternal life in Jesus’ name, and praying to God for anything we need.

All the elders and all the angels and all of creation worship Jesus and give Him glory. <span class="verseNumber">6</span>The first six seals are opened by the lamb (Jesus). As the seals are opened, wrath and destruction come upon the Earth. <span class="verseNumber">7</span>All God’s people, from every nation and tongue are sealed; brought before the throne of God in white robes, where they worship God and the lamb (Jesus), and joyfully give Him glory day and night.
