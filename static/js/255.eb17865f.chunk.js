He began making videos so that more of his extended family could access tutorials on how to approach specific maths problems and such.

Nine years after finishing high school I decided to give computer programming a go. Why? A few reasons. Firstly, I have family and friends who are into computers, so I thought it\u2019d be good to have some understanding of what they do all day. Secondly, people who work in Christian ministry ","(","like myself",")"," are often encouraged to have a hobby that gives some kind of instant feedback\u2014playing a sport, playing video game\u2014something where you can \u2018win\u2019 or at least know you\u2019re on the right track. This is because in many Christian ministries, it\u2019s hard to know if you\u2019re \u2018winning\u2019 or even on the right track, because you\u2019re primarily concerned with people and their growth. Are my congregation members growing in their faith? Are they growing in their relationships with their family? Are they growing in their love for God and those around them? These are not black-and-white things; it\u2019s hard to analyse these outcomes. This kind of \u2018spiritual growth\u2019 can be incredibly slow and non-linear. And so, it's a good idea to have things in life which feed that part of the brain that needs instant feedback. I love sport and games, but I never expected that I\u2019d enjoy computer programming. I knew it fit the category of a hobby that provided instant feedback (you can normally tell straight away if your code works or not by whether the page loads like you wanted)."]}),(0,o.jsxs)("p",{children:["The third reason I decided to give it a go is a little more subtle. Part of the role of a pastor is to teach. The Bible says that leaders in church must be \u201cable to teach\u201d ","(","2 Tim. 2:4",")",". How does a pastor teach their congregation?

In essence, it works because it aims to teach students where they are at. It helps students master concepts before moving onto the next ones. By contrast, in traditional classroom schooling, the teacher tries to help a group of students understand a topic all at the same time. They sit an exam, and then move onto the next grade if they pass\u2014whether you get 95%, 80% or 51% doesn\u2019t matter. As time goes on, they learn new concepts which build on top of the concepts they learned previously. The problem is, if students only had a shallow understanding of previous concepts, they won\u2019t get far with the advanced concepts which build on the initial foundations. In this sense, traditional classroom education can be represented with the following graph:"}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"d-flex justify-content-around mt-5",children:(0,o.jsx)("img",{style:{width:"90%",maxWidth:"400px"},src:a(8756)})}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"In the traditional approach, the variable that is constant is time: students sit in a classroom and learn the content at the same time together. This is efficient in face-to-face learning: one teacher can teach one lesson to many students. The variable that is volatile is the level of content mastery achieved by students. Some grasp concepts easily and excel, many achieve a basic grasp of the concepts, and a few sadly fall behind because they struggle to grasp the concepts."}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"Doesn\u2019t this happen in church, too? Isn\u2019t it the case that on any given Sunday, a sermon is delivered to a congregation, some of whom will grasp the concepts at a deep level, many of whom will grasp the concepts at a somewhat basic level, and some for whom the concepts will simply go over their heads?"}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"Khan Academy\u2014and many other forms of online learning\u2014try to flip these variables around. Khan Academy has a large collection of short online videos, articles and quizzes to help students learn at their own pace.

In the ideal scenario, this form of education can be represented with the following graph:"}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"d-flex justify-content-around mt-5",children:(0,o.jsx)("img",{style:{width:"90%",maxWidth:"400px"},src:a(2225)})}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"Obviously, the ideal isn\u2019t always achieved. Many students lack the motivation to watch the videos or do the exercises. Sal and the team at Khan Academy know this, and so what they advocate for is a kind of hybrid learning scenario, where students belong to a classroom with a real teacher, and it\u2019s in this environment where they are encouraged and assisted to watch the videos. This way, students can still learn at their own pace, and many students can be watching different lessons at the one time, but there is still a teacher available to help and motivate."}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"It took me a few weeks to work my way through the Khan Academy Computer Programming course.

I think this applies to theological education too. There seems to be a gap in the market for free, high-quality, online theological education. There\u2019s plenty of free low-quality stuff out there. There\u2019s some expensive high-quality stuff out there. But as far as I can tell there\u2019s nothing like a theological equivalent of Khan Academy.
