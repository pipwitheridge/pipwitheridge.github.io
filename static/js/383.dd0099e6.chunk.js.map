We all do work—whether it’s paid or unpaid, fun or boring, rewarding or shallow, for ourselves or for someone else, inside or outside the home. Seeing that so much of our lives can be described as work, it’s a good idea to stop occasionally and reflect on why we work in the first place and whether we need to change our thinking about work. \n</p>\n<p>\nJames Suzman—an anthropologist who worked as a consultant and advisor for various organizations, including the United Nations and the World Bank—traces the evolution of work through various stages of human history, from hunter-gatherer societies to the rise of farming, through the industrial revolution and into the present day. \n</p>\n<p>\nWork—\"any purposeful activity that is carried out in order to achieve a desired outcome\"—is all throughout the natural world. One thing I like about this book is that it traces work right back to the origins of life itself and explores how overcoming entropy—\"the measure of disorder or randomness in a closed system\"—is a key characteristic of work as well as a defining activity of <em>living</em> things.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe strength of the book lies not in the answers it gives about why work is the way it is, but the <em>questions</em> it forces the reader to think through concerning how we humans use our time. The final chapters are particularly controversial and provoke questions about what makes work valuable, and why so many find themselves in jobs which they find unfulfilling and even pointless. \n</p>\n<p>\nFrom a Christian perspective it’s interesting to see how this book compares to recent books about work by Christian authors. Tim Keller’s <em>Every Good Endeavour</em> or Tim Chester’s <em>The Busy Christian’s Guide to Busyness</em> are examples of attempts to explain work through a biblical/theological lens. They’re good books, but reading an unreligious account from an expert anthropologist can help sharpen or challenge some of the ideas raised by Christian authors. For example, Suzman does a better job explaining why many jobs seem trivial, and why our labour market became dominated by service sector jobs {'\\u0028'}where much of the triviality seems to reside{'\\u0029'}. While a Christian author might major on how to deal with a ‘boring’ job, Suzman displays a refreshing boldness to explore why so many seemingly pointless jobs exist in the first place. The idea that humans are evolutionarily wired to fill time by expending surplus energy is a particularly interesting idea.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's important to note that the book isn't anti-work, although it fails to provide a positive vision for the future of work.\nNevertheless, I recommend this book to anyone interested in both the biological and sociological reasons for why we work. You might not agree with all the answers Suzman offers, but I think you’ll benefit from thinking through the questions raised.  \n</p>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Work;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
