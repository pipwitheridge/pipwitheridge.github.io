What he foresees and hopes for is a gradual decline."}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{children:"Along the way, Smil drops some fascinating data points. The total energy requirement from start to finish to put a kilogram of roasted chicken on the dinner table is 300-350mL of crude oil: a remarkably efficient performance considering bread comes in at 200-250mL of crude oil per kilogram produced. Even more surprising is that to produce a kilogram of tomatoes requires about 650mL worth! This to say that vegetarian diets, while better on average than meaty diets when it comes to energy consumption, needs certain disclaimers. The ocean doesn\u2019t fare well in this exercise: the mean for all seafood is about 700mL\u2014nearly a full wine bottle of diesel fuel!"}),(0,o.jsxs)("p",{children:["Smil argues that an important way to reduce our energy consumption is to curb our food production: \u201cthere are no good reasons for maintaining our excessive food production with its attendant food waste.\u201d While many high-income countries produce about 100Kg of meat per person per year, we don\u2019t need nearly that much.

I also need to think about how much meat I consume, and try to consume less. From the perspective of ministry work I think there are lessons to be had here too\u2014that when people have competing ideas about what Christians ought to do to help fight climate change, we need to do the best we can to look at the available data, be realistic in what we expect of individuals, and not to be too certain about what the future holds.
