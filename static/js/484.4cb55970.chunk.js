It also goes deeper than you might expect, looking at the character flaws and tensions between innovators, and occasionally summarising key learnings about where innovation comes from: collaboration more than lone genius, bottom-up more than top-down, the bazaar more than the cathedral. As you might expect, the book does its job in going broad, looking at innovative technologies in turn: the computer, programming, the transistor, the microchip, video games, the internet, the personal computer, software, online, the web."}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"Part of the appeal of the history of computing is its obsessive characters.

Why did Wikipedia succeed while Nupedia flopped? Because Wiki opened the door for mass collaboration and user-generated content, and didn't snub those without a PhD. It democratised expertise, both its consumption and its production."}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"I really liked this book and would recommend to anyone interested in learning about the history of the digital age."})]})}}}]);
