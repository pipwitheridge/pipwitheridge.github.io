Not sure what Nupedia is? It was basically Wikipedia except only experts could write articles. It doesn't exist anymore. Why did Wikipedia succeed while Nupedia flopped? Because Wiki opened the door for mass collaboration and user-generated content, and didn't snub those without a PhD. It democratised expertise, both its consumption and its production.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I really liked this book and would recommend to anyone interested in learning about the history of the digital age.\n</p>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default TheInnovators;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
