As a young kid I didn\u2019t believe in God. I wondered why my parents did\u2014and I sometimes asked them about it. I went to Sunday school from time to time, and I was glad (and still am) that I was never pushed into it. Only when I reached high school did I start to read the Bible and explore the claims of Christianity for myself. Only then did I start to believe in God, the possibility of life after death, and more. As I\u2019ve grown up it\u2019s become clearer that Australia as a nation\u2014like many parts of the world\u2014is losing its religion.

He served as Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force from 2001 to 2007. Since then he has worked in various academic and director roles, and one of his main interests is history.
