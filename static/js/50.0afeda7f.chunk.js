How high should our hopes be of drastically improving the lives of the world\u2019s poorest in the 21st century?"}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"Nobel prize winners and MIT economics professors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo take readers on a journey through their findings over years of research in some of the world\u2019s poorest places. The book has two parts, the first looking at the private lives of those in poverty, the second looking at institutions such as micro-finance organisations and local governments who theoretically have a part to play in helping the poor. The authors show that whether studying the private lives of the poor or the institutions meant to help them, there are strange details which demand attention."}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"The book doesn\u2019t argue for a silver bullet policy that will make everyone prosper. Instead, it argues that in order to make progress in combatting global poverty, those involved must attend to details, understand how people make decisions, and be willing to experiment. The book raises and addresses many seemingly strange details along the way\u2014a family without enough food but with a plasma-screen TV in their living room, 50% of teachers in Indian public schools not being in front of a class when they should be, farmers only investing in fertilizer if it is brought to their door at the right time. With great sympathy the book explores the mindset of those for whom saving makes little sense when the goal of a better life seems so far off. It explains why the poor bear responsibility for too many aspects of their lives, and why those in prosperous countries have the advantage of so many of life\u2019s necessities being taken care of for us. It explains why micro-financing isn\u2019t the silver bullet some people thought it was a decade ago, and why savings accounts are unpopular amongst the poor. Perhaps most importantly, it argues that poor countries are not doomed to failure just because they are poor, or because they have had an unfortunate history."}),(0,i.jsxs)("p",{children:["The book advocates for policies which nudge people in the right direction.
