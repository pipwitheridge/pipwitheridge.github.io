As a young kid I didn’t believe in God. I wondered why my parents did—and I sometimes asked them about it. I went to Sunday school from time to time, and I was glad (and still am) that I was never pushed into it. Only when I reached high school did I start to read the Bible and explore the claims of Christianity for myself. Only then did I start to believe in God, the possibility of life after death, and more. As I’ve grown up it’s become clearer that Australia as a nation—like many parts of the world—is losing its religion. The world is arguably getting more religious, and pockets of Australia are experiencing increases in things like church attendance, but there has been an undeniable increase in people who claim ‘No Religion’ when the census rolls around. \n</p>\n<p>\nThere are plenty of general books about Australia, and plenty of general books about the history of religion, but this book is special in that it narrows in on religion in Australia. Tom Frame—the author—was born in Sydney, became a naval officer, then entered the ordained ministry of the Anglican Church. He served as Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force from 2001 to 2007. Since then he has worked in various academic and director roles, and one of his main interests is history. In this book he provides a sweep of the history of Australia and its religious beliefs. But it’s more than just a history book—it provides sociological and theological insights throughout. The book has three main parts dealing with context, causes and consequences.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The context section</strong> interprets census data and challenges stereotypes about Australia as a ‘Christian’ nation. One of the many interesting insights from this chapter comes from a 2002 survey called ‘Why People Don’t Go To Church’. The top reason provided by respondents was not because they don’t have religious beliefs (that ranked no. 2), but that services were seen as boring and unfulfilling. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The causes section</strong> gives reasons for why the number of Australians who call themselves Christian has dropped: \n</p>\n<p>\n<ul>1. The growth of alternative community organisations and clubs which reduce the net from which churchgoers were drawn.</ul>\n<ul>2. The collapse of the Sunday School movement and the demise of many large youth groups.</ul>\n<ul>3. The decline of tokenism and the end of nominalism.</ul>\n<ul>4. An increase in peoples’ familiarity with alternative views of the natural world.</ul>\n<ul>5. The combination of a more open discussion of atheism and agnosticism, a disdain for religious extremism, and the erosion of concern about judgement/afterlife.</ul>\n<ul>6. The church’s reaction to the latest scientific thinking (i.e. wanting to oppose research and restrict personal freedom).</ul>\n<ul>7. The church’s inability to speak with one clear voice on compelling issues and core doctrines.</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nApparently another issue is that Christianity offers things that modern Australia doesn't care about. It offers truth at a time when people are wary of claims to truth. It offers forgiveness of sins in an age where moral failings are not a priority issue. It offers a heavenly destiny to people who already enjoy long lives and material abundance. The result is that most people don't actively reject Christianity—they passively ignore it because it doesn't matter.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>The consequences section</strong> explores the rise of anti-theism and possible futures for the religious landscape in Australia. It looks at famous anti-theists from overseas—Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris and so on—before looking at some from Australia—Phillip Adams, Terry Lane, Tamas Pataki. In looking at the growing disrespect between believers and unbelievers, Frame gives an interesting opinion: “I attribute the main sources of discord to conservative Protestants and positive atheists. Neither group seems able to accept the reality of the other’s existence.” Frame looks at ‘Doctrinaire Secularism’ and the observation that even mentioning God in the public square is becoming questionable. He then argues for a best-case secular society: “I believe that the principal objective of contemporary Australian secularism must be the creation and maintenance of an open and inclusive society that recognizes the importance of religious views to those who hold and which respects the integrity and sincerity of religious communities in their quest for truth and purpose.”\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNeedless to say, there is much in this book that is controversial, and most of it is gold. I didn’t agree with everything, but even the things I didn’t agree with made me reflect. I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it particularly to any Christian inclined towards ‘mission’ or evangelism—anyone who wants to understand the religious landscape of Australia better and the possible reasons why Australians seem to be losing their religion. \n</p>\n\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default LosingMyReligion;"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
