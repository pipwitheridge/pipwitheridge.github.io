As technology has evolved so has the way Christians learn the faith. For example, Bible Gateway and the YouVersion Bible App, among other things, have made free, user-friendly access to the bible possible for more people than ever. Software like Logos and Accordance has enhanced the experience of studying the Bible in its original language for many people. Theological colleges are increasingly looking for ways to provide teaching content online. Churches, too. All this to say, if you have these skills I think it's worth considering if you could work in organisations like these. On YouTube, programming influencers put companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon on a pedestal. But perhaps an organisation with a gospel vision would provide more interesting work. It's worth thinking about."})]})}}}]);
