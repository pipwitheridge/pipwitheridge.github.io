Here's a short timeline of my coding journey to date:</p>\n    <div><strong>December 2021 {\"\\u2192\"}</strong> I began learning HTML, CSS and Javascript using Khan Academy. \n    I built a few basic tools for my Greek/Hebrew studies. </div>\n    <br></br>\n    <div><strong>October 2022 {\"\\u2192\"}</strong> I learned about React & React Native and decided to make an app to help with biblical Hebrew/Greek translation practice on the go.\n     It's called <strong>Tindel</strong> and its available for <a className=\"smallAnchor\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/tindel/id1643629446\">iOS</a> and <a className=\"smallAnchor\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tindel\">Android</a>, and there's a version for <a className=\"smallAnchor\" href=\"https://pipwitheridge.github.io/tindel-web\">web</a> too.\n    </div>\n    <br></br>\n    <div><strong>January 2023 {\"\\u2192\"}</strong> I built this personal website to share some thoughts via book reviews and blog posts. I could've used a website generator like Wix or WordPress, but I wanted to have a go coding it myself. As part of the process I wanted to \n    learn how to build a comments system. Feel free to leave a comment on a book review or blog post... I hope the website doesn't break!\n    </div>          \n    <br></br>\n    <p>In my post \"Learning From Sal Khan\" I wrote about the learning process and what it taught me about education in general.</p>\n    <p>If you're reading this and you're a Christian into programming, and you're thinking about what work you might want to do in the future, it's worth thinking about how you could use your skills to further theological education in some way. As technology has evolved so has the way Christians learn the faith. For example, Bible Gateway and the YouVersion Bible App, among other things, have made free, user-friendly access to the bible possible for more people than ever. Software like Logos and Accordance has enhanced the experience of studying the Bible in its original language for many people. Theological colleges are increasingly looking for ways to provide teaching content online. Churches, too. All this to say, if you have these skills I think it's worth considering if you could work in organisations like these. On YouTube, programming influencers put companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon on a pedestal. But perhaps an organisation with a gospel vision would provide more interesting work. It's worth thinking about.</p>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default MyCoding;"],"names":["className","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
