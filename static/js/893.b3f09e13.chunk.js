For example, if someday, through advances in neuroscience, we could create a drug which turned hunger and hatred into the most pleasurable experiences one could have, would that be good? If everyone signed up to take the drug, starved themselves and turned on each other, would human wellbeing be globally achieved for the first time? This is a moral dilemma that exposes some of the issues with Harris\u2019 first premise. To his credit, he does raise a similar hypothetical in the end notes, but with no satisfactory answer. Earlier in the book he argues that it seems desirable for our brain states to be tethered to events in the real world\u2014and so for example, if one\u2019s child died in an accident, most parents would refuse a drug which completely removed their sense of grief\u2014grief is deemed a better response than apathy because it is tethered to reality. However, this isn\u2019t explored thoroughly enough to provide a compelling answer."}),(0,a.jsxs)("p",{children:["The premise that questions of morality are essentially questions about human wellbeing is even more problematic.

Many Christians will say that a \u2018core\u2019 belief they hold is that the reports about Jesus\u2019 life given by people who saw him in the first century are generally trustworthy. If Jesus\u2019 words and actions\u2014including his crucifixion and resurrection\u2014are recorded accurately, that for many people is the ballgame. Peoples\u2019 beliefs about angels, demons, and the like, bizarre as they may seem to non-believers, generally stem from a prior, core belief\u2014at least in my experience. As a Christian, I know I don\u2019t have all the answers. There are mysteries in my worldview still. Solely attacking these more mysterious beliefs fails to recognize where they stem from. Similarly, if I was to attack the respectability of atheism by highlighting the seemingly bizarre belief that \u201cthe universe came from nothing\u201d, I\u2019m confident I would not win over many people."}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:"Although I fundamentally disagree with Harris, I appreciate his book and the way it pushes me to consider a radically different worldview.

I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it for anyone\u2014atheist or believer\u2014who wants to explore an atheist\u2019s vision for a human morality determined by science."})]})}}}]);
